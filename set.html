The island is serviced by the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_E._King_International_Airport> Cyril E. King International Airport</a> and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Amalie_Harbor_Seaplane_Base> Charlotte Amalie Harbor Seaplane Base.</a> 

   
        <p>Passenger and limited car-ferry services to neighboring islands
        
        such as Water Island, Saint John, Saint Croix, and the British Virgin
        
        Islands run regularly out of the Red Hook Terminal, Charlotte Amalie,
        
        and Crown Bay Marina.</p>
        
        <p>The United States Virgin Islands is the only place under United
        
        States jurisdiction where the rule of the road is to 
       
       <b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_on_the_left" id="a-complex1">drive on the left </a> </b>. 
        
	This was inherited from what was the then-current Danish practice at the 	time

	of the American acquisition in 1917. However, because the islands are a

	<strong> U.S. territory </strong> , 
	most cars are imported from the mainland United States, and therefore the

	steering column is located on the left side of the vehicle. </p>
